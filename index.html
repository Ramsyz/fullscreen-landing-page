        There are numerous benefits to travelling if we think about it. The
        first one being, we get to meet new people. When you meet new people,
        you get the opportunity to make new friends. It may be a fellow
        traveller or the local you asked for directions. Moreover, new age
        technology has made it easier to keep in touch with them. Thus, it
        offers not only a great way to understand human nature but also explore
        new places with those friends to make your trip easy.

        Similar to this benefit, travelling makes it easier to understand
        people. You will learn how other people eat, speak, live and more. When
        you get out of your comfort zone, you will become more sensitive towards
        other cultures and the people.

        Another important factor which we learn when we travel is learning new
        skills. When you go to hilly areas, you will most likely trek and thus,

        very important thing which travelling teaches us is to enjoy nature. It
